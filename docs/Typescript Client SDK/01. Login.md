title: 01. Login
---

Following on the the installation code we just wrote [here](https://docs.identigo.org/Typescript Client Sdk)
To start the login process call the login method.

```typescript
auth.login();
```

This will send the user to the Identigo login page.
When the user logs in, they will be redirected back to your app and at that point, everything is pretty much done for you.

At that stage you can get the user and their properties like this

```typescript
const user = auth.user;
const userAppRoles = auth.roles;
const userAppAttributes = user.attrbutes;
```
