# Webauthn

A cool feature in Identigo is that you have access to use Webauthn out the box. Webauthn is an awesome, powerful and secure way of offering a fast means of login to you users, by using their device.

The first stage in that happening is that a user can first login with a username and password. Once they have done that, you can offer them the means to register a device. You can do that like this.

```typescript
auth.registerDevice();
```

This will redirect the user to the Identigo device registration page.
The user will follow that flow and be redirected back to the app.

The user can then use the "Login with Device" option on login, if webauthn is enabled on the app in question.
