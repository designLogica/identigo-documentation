# Apps

Apps are really the starting point of getting things working in Identigo.

As explained in <a href="https://docs.identigo.org/Getting Started/Architecture">here</a>

When Identigo starts for the first time it will create its default app of Identigo. This is what it will use when you login to the admin UI.

You should of created a primary admin user when you first loaded the app.
Login to the admin ui and with that user and go navigate to apps.

## Add users

You can then add users to this app. You can do this within the app ui and either create and add a user, or search and add a user.

Once a user is added, they can login.
