### Creating the primary admin user

Navigate to the admin panel at <a href="http://localhost:3000/admin">localhost:3000/admin</a>

When no user is in the system, you will be prompted to create that initial user.

This is done initially with a username and password. You can add MFA, passwordless or webauthn later if you want to.

This user will be able to log in and admin the entire system, across all apps, but only from the Identigo admin panel.

You can use the SDK to edit users and so on from their respective apps.
