# Users

As users can belong to many apps, it stands to reason that a user can also belong to no apps at all.

We give you the ability to add global users in the users ui. This is where you can add users ready to be assigned to any of your apps later.

If there is a user created and they are not assigned to any apps, they there will be no way they can login.

#### Roles and Attributes

Because roles and attributes are all app specific, you can not manually change those thigs on the global user record. If you want to view this app specific data, you can view the users record in the app ui, you can do that by clicking on the app name in the list of apps the user is a member of
